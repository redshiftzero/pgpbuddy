If messages are successfully handled, we delete that message after we respond to them, and as well as the PGP public key we download after it has been used to generate the response. \r\n\r\nNote on logging: During beta testing, we are logging messages that we fail to respond to appropriately in order to determine what additional situations PGP buddy should be able to handle. \r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with PGP buddy?
